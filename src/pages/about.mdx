---

Hi, my name is Andrea Vouk (He/His) and I'm a professional software developer based in Italy.

I'm self-taught through books and the internet, my interests range from sysadmin/SRE/virtualization stuff to
cloud development and Kubernetes.

Also, big fan of Apache Kafka, Proxmox and distributed systems in general (hopefully, more blog posts coming in the future).

These days, I mainly code in TypeScript and Python3, but I'm also proficient in Java, C# (.NET 6+), Bash and, of course,
classic old school C99.

A much more detailed listing about technologies used can be found on my LinkedIn page, for those interested.

I'm open to collaborations and interesting new job opportunities.

Feel free to contact me (see [contacts](/contacts) page)
