description: "About Andrea Vouk"
---

My name is Andrea Vouk (He/His) and I'm a professional software developer based in Italy.

I'm self-taught through books and the internet, and I'm very passionate about building stuff.

These days, I mainly code in TypeScript and Python3, but I'm also proficient in Java, C# (.NET 6+) and classic old school C.

Stuff that I build includes backend systems, desktop native GUIs (Qt/Wpf) and other
random stuff (shell scripts, libs, etc.). Also, if something can be containerized, be sure that it will be :)

I have decent SRE (k8s), SysAdmin (Linux based, ESXi) and DevOps (Packer, Ansible) skills but these are not roles
that excite me much, rather something that I've had to learn along the road for necessity.
I still enjoy them though, sometimes...

I'm always open to collaborate on interesting projects, so feel free to reach out.
