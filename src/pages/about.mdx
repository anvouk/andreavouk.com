description: "About Andrea Vouk"
---

My name is Andrea Vouk (He/His) and I'm a professional software developer based in Italy.

I'm self-taught through books and the internet, and my interests range from web development to Kubernetes
to Linux SysAdmin work and to clouds.

I'm experienced in developing for and maintaining Kubernetes clusters (on clouds, on-premise, air-gapped (!)),
managing Linux VMs and building backends with integrations to Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.

These days, I mainly code in TypeScript and Python3, but I'm also proficient in Java, C# (.NET 6+), Bash and, of course,
classic old school C99.

I'm open to collaborations and interesting new job opportunities.
If you're interested, feel free to contact me (see [contacts](/contacts) page)
